### Introduction
Over the last years, data science and analytics jobs have increased exponentially. Around 2.5 million terabytes of data are created each day, and people capable of analyzing it are becoming more and more sought after by companies. Having this into account, we decided to explore this area even further and come up with the data insights to show all interested students at NOVA IMS their job opportunities. This project presents interesting and valuable visualizations like scatter plots or maps from all type of jobs in the area of Data Analytics, namely Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Business Analyst.
